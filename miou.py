    Intersection over union (IoU) is a common evaluation metric for semantic
    segmentation. The predictions are first accumulated in a confusion matrix
    and the IoU is computed from it as follows:

        IoU = true_positive / (true_positive + false_positive + false_negative).

    The mean IoU is the mean of IoU between all classes.

    Keyword arguments:
        num_classes (int): number of classes in the classification problem.
